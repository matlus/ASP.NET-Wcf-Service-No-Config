# ASP.NET-WCF Service - No Configuration
This projects starts with an Empty ASP.NET project and then builds (using code) an ASP.NET based WCF service application. As a result there are no configuration settings to deal with and no "Magic" happening behind the scenes.

In addition the project uses ASP.NET Rotuing to route the WCF Endpoint to the correct Service class (analogous to an MCV Controller)
